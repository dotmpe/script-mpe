Generic::

    <box> <subcmd> <prefix>/ :<check>

``<check>`` target spec corresponds either an executable target, or
an alias to exutable targets.

The executables are another ``<box>:<subcmd>``, or a wrapper script providing the same.


pd run [ <prefix> | [:]<target> ]...
  TODO: translate targets to command invocation, and run at prefixes.

  - normally accept 0,3,4,5. monitor io: passed/skipped/error/failed.

  XXX: some states are directly associated with targets. Work into htd/box
  rules?

  Should selectively run targets for prefixes.

    pd run <prefix>:<target-x> <prefixes>.. :<target-y>

pd test
  - normally accept 0,4

pd check
  - normally accept 0,4

pd status
  - normally accept 0,3,4

TODO capture passed/skipped/error/failed IO and do more detailed status,
enable re-runs.
