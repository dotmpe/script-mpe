## Test suites

### Baseline
Keep the test-suite runner working. The main component to test is shell scripts
as if they where tooling for the current project.

- lib.feature
- runner.feature
- \_boilerplate.feature

### Status tables
Tracking and handling some kind of structure lines is usefull for combining
metadata (config, settings) into user-scripts.

- stattab.feature

### Package metadata
### Project workflows

See projectdir, and user-tools repos.
