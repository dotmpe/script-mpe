res - Read metadata from metafiles.

Types to represent anything. The objective is using this as a toolkit, to
integrate into programs that work on metadata and/or (media) files. The hope is
to separate it according to focus into different projects or components, someday.

Module dir:
  - res.lst - misc. types of simple lists from plain-text: dates, numbers, URL's
  - res.todo - TODO.txt format on steriods
  - res.task - data sync and events for res.txt items
  - res.txt - this file, interfaces and abstract types
  - res.bm - formats for bookmark exports, JSON and HTML
  - res.fs - list and walk filesytem, with include/exclude name matching
  - res.ws - work with metadirs as context
  - res.vc - find version-control repositories and list contents

Metafile dotdirs and files
--------------------------
TODO: move some higher level res.metafile docs here.

Plain-text items and lists
--------------------------
res.txt is a customizable factory/generator style parser that takes in a file at
list-parser and lets a line-parser extract the same fields each line using
handlers provided a number of type mixins.

It includes varying abstract strategies for parser setup and result handling.
A simple list-item type is provided, which represents an item from a plain-test
list as a complex structure

 - text
 - attributes

TODO: refactor so that result isn't a bunch of AbstractTxtLineParser instances.
XXX: line fields/types and list record keying and sorting.

Based on this pattern, some subtypes are given elsewhere in `res` for
specific formats: TODO.txt

----

TODO:
  - res.disk
  - res.metafile - metadir and metafile types for dotfiles and dotdirs as markers
    and default file locations

TODO:
- Persist composite objects:
- Metalink reader/adapter. Metalink4 <-> HTTPResponseHeaders
- Content-* properties
- Combine with or harves cllct, and existing rsr and taxus projects.
