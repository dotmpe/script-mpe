## Shell/decl: track shell declarations for more optimal type handling

# Test, what is faster e.g. to check for array/Array type?
# Look at speed implications for each method.

# A. process opts from `typeset -p` output, or
# B. 1. store opts in one assoc arr, or
# B. 2. one array for each opt, or
# C. use standard simple variables using variable name keying

# Numbers below. Observations:
# Surprised the `typeset -p` subshell has this large an impact compared to
# case/esac. And clearly caching improves runtime more than one order
# of magnitude. Associative arrays showing a tiny but noticable improvement
# over regular variables (most or all of the times).

# Did not do test B.2 because it seems like it would be worse than either B
# or C anyway, as case/esac has little impact and B.2. would double 'access
# time' to get rid of just the opts matching...

# See also other previous benchmarks:
#
# - tools/bookmark/bm-sh-type.sh
#   how typeset -F is a superior check for types (0.1us on t460s vs. 450 microseconds for type -t plus str cmp).
#
# - tools/benchmark/bm-sh-regex-case.sh
#   compare regex vs. case/esac string matching (1.7 vs 1.2 ms @t460s)
#   Even test is (a bit) slower (1.5ms).
#
# - tools/benchmark/bm-sh-test.sh (test -n "str" runs in 9us @t460s)

# Conclusion: some of these numbers need review because I'm not sure all adds
# up. But probably want to review more automatic profiling method, etc.

# Regardless, numbers are very favorable towards:
#
# 1. as little subshells as needed (what else is new...)
# 2. better arrays than classical variables with magic names, but either is not
#    bad. At least because here the symbols are already variable names
#    so they need no further encoding to use as 'key'.
# 3. case/esac wins for simple str match, same as other string expansions.
#
# And I think regex (don't forget BASH_REMATCH) easily outperforms any
# external program but that is just an semi-informed opinion atm. Need to do
# some testing of regex builtin vs. grep/awk/sed/perl/ag/rg/... some day
# but regex'ing is not too important right away.

# Update: added ${var@A} expansion, only performs slightly worse than var/arr
# caching.
# But so littering env with chached opts may be sub optimal.
# Of course, nothing is said yet about large arrays.
