``package.y*ml``: YAML file for project metadata
================================================

Root level is a list, with at least one object.
TODO: if no ``main`` attribute is given it is equal to the current checkout dirs
name.

Items in the root list may be an object, that may conform to the schema::

  type: <mediatype>
  id: <main-id>

The ``main`` attribute value is used as project or package-id. The main
package is one object from the list with settings for Pd, Htd etc.
XXX: The intent is to store different kinds of project config metadata in one
common file, ie. need to abstract into one or several YAML dialect (Uses JSON
schema to validate blocks).

TODO: The ``mediatype`` should be used to distinguish each config block as an
implementation of extension of some config scheme.
Currently the type is mostly ignored and the following are equiv.::

  - main: my-project-2018
    my-setting: 123
  - id: my-project-2018

and:

  - main: my-project-2018
    my-setting: 123
    id: my-project-2018

TODO: perhaps allow 'packages' or '<prefix>.{type,package}' schemes for root mapping iso. lists.

NOTE: version concerns main component version, not metadata

TODO: .env by docker-compose modes: import or symlink/write

Usage
-----
User commands via ``htd``, see help. Eg::

    htd package update
    htd package sh-scripts  init check build clean
    htd package remotes-reset

Other subcommands can use ``package.lib.sh`` and access JSON and Shell script
variant generated from the main ``package.{y*ml,json}``.

The variants are re-written by ``update``, and stored at ``$PWD/.meta/package/*``.

Pre-processing is done on ``#include NAME`` directives. If found, lines like
these are substituted by the file contents retrieved at `NAME`.
`PACKMETA` is set to point to the compiled file, not the projects metadata document.
`PACKMETA_SRC` env will point to the project package file.

The main uses currently for package:

- provide routines for project tasks
- list remote repositories, or checkout instances
- establish a mode for env initialization

See `test/pd-spec <test/pd-spec.rst>`_  for tested specifications.
Specifically `spec pd/0/1/6 <test/pd-spec#/pd/0/1/6>`_  that describes how the
scripts interact with the Pdoc, local package metadata and other context.

XXX: using YAML requries JSOTK present. Converting YAML or JSON to shell also
requires jsotk.

Files
-----
For YAML first a JSON variant is generated. From the JSON variant, the main
block is extracted with ``jq``.

This main block is converted to shell vars, see `jsotk` ``fkv`` format. It
should support simple numbers, strings or lists of strings as values.

NOTE: This causes the following to be equivalent::

  {"key1": {"value": 123}}
  {"key1-value": 123}
  {"key1/value": 123}
  {"key1.value": 123}
  {"key1_value": 123}

Ie ``key1_value=123``.


Attributes
-----------------------------

environments
  Name(s) for environment(s). If given, first is the default, unless ENV_NAME is set. These are only names, that together with ``env`` to provide control to set/define the environment for scripts.

env
  Script lines to initialize environment. At this stage ENV_NAME is set, but
  nothing else is sourced yet. If a cmd line or script is provided, it should
  update (load/modify/execute) the env setup for the other package scripts.

  If not given, the default is effectively ``. $PACK_SH``, to make all of
  the package's main settings available under ``package_*=...``.

scripts
  Mapping of named scripts for this project, used with alike named subcommands.
  Like the identical attribute in NPM's package.json.
  FIXME: Accept shell scripts, or ``pd run`` targets.

  Common names:

  check
    Scripts with pre-commit, pre-clean etc. checklist; should run fast.
    The results are used with ``pd stat``.

  test
    Scripts verifying correct functioning of project.

  init
    Script(s) for post-checkout/unpack initialization.
    Default is to (re)generate local git hooks.

  build
    Build the project from source.

  TODO: stats
    Additional scripts with results for ``pd stat``, but that would have no
    significance as a check.

  tasks
    List open tasks in project, one item per line.
    Default: ``htd list-paths | xarg radical.py``

  TODO: dist .. pack?
    Package the project.

  TODO: pub
    Publish.

  TODO: sync
    Default: make sure checkout is clean, and every local branch is at least one
    (off-disk/host) remote.


pd-script
  Like scripts, but with all values formatted as pd targets.

pd-meta
  Attribute for supplementary metadata to projectdir/doc scripts.

  All of these map to the Projectdoc schema. A description of the
  basic ones usefull in a Package file context are given here. But
  on initializing a prefix any attribute under pd-meta should be consolidated
  with the Pd attributes for that prefix. [spec pd-0.1.4.]

  init
    To override the default initialization (``pd init``, called indirectly
    by ``pd enable``)::

      pd update-meta
      pd update-hooks

  hooks
    Names of GIT client hooks. Defaults:

    pre-commit::

      pd check

  git-hooks
    A map list of names to filenames, for where to store tracked scripts.
    The keys correspond to .git/hook/* scriptnames, and if a script is not
    tracked then its default path is used and is not to be specified here.

    (Pd generates scripts is not present from other pd-meta attrs.)

  check
    Run with ``pd check *``. Default is to auto-detect.

    The script or script lines to execute for a simple checkup on the
    project. Recommended is to check for some sane state, wrt. version,
    SCM, syntax (ie. linter), etc. This can use any of the arguments
    values for ``pd run``.

  test
    Run with ``pd test``.

    The script to execute for a full test of the project.

    The degree as to wether the project is installed for such an execution
    is not specified. Except that its return code should indicate the
    result: 1 for failed, 2 for unstable, 3 for TODO, 4 for skipped.
    This can use any of the arguments values for ``pd run``.

  tasks
    Metadata for tasks (issue/ticket/time) tracking per project

    tags
      A list of tags used throughout the code to mark comments with tasks.
      Possibly only to identify local code, or also to usually to associate code
      blocks with issue/ticket/time tracker records.

      TODO: A list of objects to further specificy backend of tag?
      See ie. jnk/userContent.git

    document
      Name of a local file serving as central storage for project tasks.

    ignore
      sentinel
        TODO: ignore lines by pattern
      glob
        TODO: ignore files by pathname glob

  docs
    Metadata for document (wiki/specs/manual/license) tracking per project.

    tags
      A list of tags used throughout the literal data to link to other
      documents.


  trackers
    A list of objects to represent an tracker, ie. an index of tracked
    references.

    Usually projects have one bug tracker. But also local or remote
    docuemntation, specifications, planning, etc.
    XXX: this should probably be a schema on its own.

    - slug:
      url:
      tags:
      ...:


- TODO: auto-detect pd check, test, init to run.
- TODO: add --pd-force and/or some prefix option for pd check, test, init to run.
- FIXME: `application/x-*` is not a valid mediatype [#]_
  Rename to `application/vnd.org.wtwta.project`.

.. [#] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18969938/vendor-mime-types-for-api-versioning


status
  TODO: items for weather, health (wall monitors, badges, version tracking),
  either external or local?

  XXX: Convert to STM config?
    - type: application/vnd.org.wtwta.monitor
      static: build/monitor.json
      update:
      - pd status -
      - pd-meta -O json > build/monitor.json

  Pd scripts return status codes and lists of failed targets, that are
  cached iot. track project state. Ie. checkout modifications, failing test
  cases.

  The basic state is 'status:result'.
  Other states are recorded below 'status', and each ``<prefix>:status``.


- TODO: npm supports various script attributes that are interesting for Pd
  package schema.

  - install, and pre-/post-~ I suppose can help a bit to kick of a build.

  - prepublish (run before local 'npm install' too).

  - npm does also version bump or tags with ``npm version``

  And there is publish when uploading to NPM registry.
  stop/start, and restart.

Environment Attributes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to a ``main`` package declaration with metadata, it can be
usefull to track environments for this package. Using YAML aliases
it is also possible to re-use (parts of) environment definitions.

cwd
  ..
version
  While project ``version`` metadata does not reflect checkout directly, with `git.lib` either version setting can be used to create a special checkout at `Local-Source`_.
env
  ..
env-name
  ..
scripts
  ..

Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Static globals, should be managed in user shell profile.

Should only change by reloading ``ENV``, or maybe by resetting some ``ENV_*`` and calling some partial reinit, with hooks..

.. _Env:

- ``$ENV``:

.. _Env-Name:

- ``$ENV_NAME``:

.. _Vnd-Gh-Src:

- ``$VND_GH_SRC``: default: ``/src/github.com``

.. _Local-Source:

- ``$LOCAL_SOURCE``: default: ``/src/local``

.. _Projects:

- ``$PROJECTS``: PATH-like var for project dirs

  default: ``$HOME/project:/srv/project-local:/src/*.*/:/src/local/``

.. _Project-Dir:

- ``$PROJECT_DIR``: preferred dir for project

  default: ``/srv/project-local`` if exists else ``~/project/``

..
